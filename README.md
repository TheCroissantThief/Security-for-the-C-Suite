# Securing the C-Suite
    
This capstone project integrates 4 distinct components with the goal of instructing senior corporate executives in the basics of effective cybersecurity response. We use a keylogger, a presentation, an informational pamphlet, and a writeup of our keylogger code to describe how an organization should respond to cybersecurity events.
