The first line of coourse is the "shebang" this path is the directory to python, and allows the executable to be ran on a certain machine

The third line imports the random module, this module generates pseudo-random numbers.  For our example we used randint, which generates a random integer within our specified range

The fourth line imports the pynput module.  Pynput allows you to control and monitor input devices.  Mouse and Keyboard being the primary devices.  From this module we import Key, Listener, and Controller 

Line 6 we assign a variable a string value. We want it to be a random string added to a random integer from the module we imported.  This approach ensures that the output files will not be written over each other to give us better access to our target's keystrokes                                                                                                         
In line 8 we create, open and name the new file using our new variable and by giving it write permissions. This allows our script to write to the file
